# Project Title
> Replace this with the name of your project, e.g., "Trie Data Structure with
Autocomplete Demo"
## Introduction
Describe the data structure you chose, what it does, and why it’s interesting.
Example: "A Trie is a tree-like data structure used to store strings efficiently
for prefix-based searches."
## Features
List the main features of your project:
- Core data structure operations (insert, search, delete, etc.)
- Features of the demo application
## How the Data Structure Works
Explain in plain language how the data structure is organized and how it operates.
### Time and Space Complexity
| Operation | Average Case | Worst Case |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Insert | O(...) | O(...) |
| Search | O(...) | O(...) |
| Delete | O(...) | O(...) |
## File Structure
Explain the folder and file organization.
```
/src # Source code
/include # Header files
/tests # Test cases
main.cpp # Demo application
```
## Installation / Setup
Step-by-step instructions to set up the project locally.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
g++ -std=c++17 src/*.cpp -o demo
./demo
```
## Usage
Explain how to run the program and what inputs to try.
Include example console output or screenshots.
## Application Demo
Describe the application you built to demonstrate your data structure's strengths.
## Testing
Explain how you tested your code and how someone else can run the tests.
## References
List any resources you used to research or implement your data structure.
## Optional Sections
### Video Walkthrough
Link to a video demo of your project (YouTube, Loom, etc.).
### Future Improvements
List ideas for expanding your project in the future.
### License
State the license for your project (e.g., MIT License).
